# About this sample

The goal of this sample is to illustrate a Cloud pattern to process multiple documents saved in an Azure Storage with Form Recognizer.

# Architecture

![architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/architecture.png)

Hereâ€™s more details for the different parts of this architecture.

1 - The seeder sends X documents with the tag status with the value unprocessed to the container document in Azure Storage.

2a - The train model function gets a SAS from the model container.

2b - The function sends the path of the container and all metadata to Form Recognizer.

3c - Form Recognizer retrieves all the files needed to create the custom model and train the model.

3a - The processor function starts retrieving documents (blobs) from the storage.

3b - The processor function sends the documents to be analyzed to Form Recognizer.

4 - The Blazor viewer app retrieves the status from the processor function.

5 - If needed, the Blazor viewer app can restart or terminate any processor function app or start/stop the whole process.

# Azure Resources deployed in this sample

## Seeder

The seeder is a VM where a console app (C#) is installed.  The goal of this application is to create documents (blobs) in an Azure Storage.

Each document will be marked with a tag **status** with the value **unprocessed**.

We are leveraging the [indexing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-index-how-to?tabs=azure-portal) feature of Azure Storage to retrieve documents in storage that need to be processed.

The seeder app is leveraging multithreading in C#, one thread will create X number of documents adding the specific tag in the Azure storage.

## Storage (Document)

This storage contains all the documents that need to be processed and analyzed by Form Recognizer. 

It also contains the model to train and the output from the Durable Processor Function.  The data is saved in a Table Storage.

## Storage (Functions)

This storage is used by all Azure Functions in the architecture for their internal working.

## Train Model Function

This Azure function will train the [Custom Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/concept-custom) in Form Recognizer.  Four endpoints are provided in this Azure Function.

| Endpoint | HTTP Verb |Description
|----------|------------|----------
| /api/TrainCustomModel | POST | This endpoint needs to be called to train the custom model in Form Recognizer.
| /api/GetCustomModel | GET | This endpoint returns the definition of a specific custom model
| /api/GetCustomModels | GET | This endpoint returns all custom models trained in Form Recognizer
| /api/DeleteCustomModel | DELETE | This endpoint deletes a specific custom trained model.

## Form Recognizer

Azure Applied AI Services, uses machine learning technology to identify and extract key-value pairs and table data from form documents.  For more information about Form Recognizer click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/).

## Durable Function Processor

This function app uses two types of [eternal durable functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-eternal-orchestrations?tabs=csharp) (Collector and Processor) and a [durable entity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-entities) (BlobInfoEntity).

### BlobInfo Durable Entity

The BlobInfo is a single durable entity used to store the blob metadata. It's split into three sections:

- The backlog: Unprocessed blobs ready to be processed.
- The partitions: Blobs currently processed by a processor instance.
- The processed cache: Blobs recently processed are kept into cache to prevent race conditions where the Blob storage is updated yet.

### Collector Function

The Collector is a single-instance eternal function which is responsible of fetching unprocessed blobs. The goal is to maintain a sufficient backlog, so the Processors never run out of blobs tor process. It runs every 10 seconds by default.

#### Flow chart:

![Collector flow chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/src/processor/Diagrams/Collector-Flowchart.png)

#### Sequence digram:

![Collector sequence diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/src/processor/Diagrams/Collector-Sequence.png)

### Processor Function

The Processor consists of multiple instances or an eternal function. It's responsible for sending the blobs to Form Recognizer for processing, saving the results and updating the blobs states.

Each instance has its own partition (or slice) of blobs to process. For example, if batch size is 1000 and there's 10 instances, every instance will process 100 blobs per execution.

It starts by sending the whole partition to Form Recognizer and before starting to query for results. This prevents wasting transactions (which count towards the TPS limit) to query results before Form Recognizer has completed its processing.

The results are saved to table storage, including the form fields and the OCR of the document. In case of a failure, the exception information is also included. If the call is throttled by Form Recognizer (transient failure), the processor will automatically retry.

#### Sequence digram:

![Processor sequence diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/src/processor/Diagrams/Processor-Sequence.png)

### Error handling

The Collector and the Processor functions have to be always running and use the same technique for error handling. In case of on an unhandled exception, the current instance fails and a new instance is started with the same inputs. The [Viewer](#blazor-server-viewer) can be used to view the exceptions. The Processor also handles error at the blob level and unhandled exceptions will be available in the output table.

## Blazor Server Viewer

This Blazor application can be used to control the processing. The Start action link at the top starts the Collector and Processor instances while the Clear action link will terminate all running instances and reset the current entity data.

It can also be used to follow execution progress. The first line represents the Collector instance and the following lines represents the different Processor instances. 

You'll find details like the instance id, the status, the duration, etc. For the Processor instances, you'll also see the partition id and the statistics, like the number of documents processed vs failed and the number of transient failures (throttling). 

You can also use the action links to restart, terminate or purge the history for a specific instance. 

Finally, in case of a failure, you'll see the previous instance id. If you uncheck "Hide failed instances", you'll be able to see the exception that caused the previous instance to fail.

## Monitoring

All Azure functions log their metric in Application Insight and Log Analytics.

# Installation

This section describes all the steps you need to install this sample in your Azure environment.

## Step 1 - Fork the GitHub Repository

Click the button in the top right corner to Fork the git repository.

![function](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/fork.png)

## Step 2 - Create a Service Principal for the GitHub Action

All the creation of the Azure resources and deployment of all applications is done in this sample using a GitHub Action.  You will need to create a service principal that will be used to deploy everything.

To achieve this, please follow this [link](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-login).  Be sure to save the output generated by the command line.  You will need it after to create a **GitHub Secret**.

The output will look like below.  Copy it in your clipboard.

![sp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/spoutput.png)


## Step 3 - Create needed GitHub Secrets

For the GitHub Action to run properly you need to create 3 secrets.

First go to the Settings tab.

![settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/settings.png)

Next click the **Secrets** button in the left menu.

![leftmenu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/leftmenu.png)

You will need to create three secrets.

![secrets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/secrets.png)

| Secret Name | Description 
|-------------|------------
| ADMIN_USERNAME | This is the username to login in the Seeder VM
| ADMIN_PASSWORD | This is the secret to login in the Seeder VM
| AZURE_CREDENTIALS | This is the value returned when creating the Service Principal from the previous step

## Step 4 - Run the GitHub Action

Now it is time to deploy and create all resources in Azure.  To do this, go to the GitHub Action tab.

![action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/actionmenu.png)

Because you **forked** this repo, you won't see by default the GitHub action, you will need to enable it.

![action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/enablegh.png)

Once the GitHub Action is enabled, you will see on action in the left menu called **Deploy**.  Select it and, on the right, you will see a drop-down list with the action Run workflow.  

Click on it, you can leave the default parameters in place or change them if you want.

![workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/workflow.png)

| Parameter | Description
|-----------|------------
| Name of the resource group | This is the name of the resource group created in Azure that will contain all the resources.
| Location | This is where all resources will be created
| CIDR VNET | This is the CIDR address of the VNET that will contain the Seeder VM
| CIDR Subnet | This is the CIDR that will contain the VM

When you are ready, click the green button **Run workflow**

Now you can follow the GitHub Action running by clicking the execution.

![workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/execution.png)

This should take some time, once everything finishes to run, proceed to next step.

![workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/stepsgh.png)

## Step 5 - Train the model

Now that everything is deployed correctly you need to train the model in Form Recognizer.

Clone the git repository on your machine, you will see a **folder** called **model**.

![workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/folder.png)

Now, go to the Azure Portal in the new resource group that contains all the resources.

You will see two Azure Storage accounts, you need to go to the one that have a tag **description** with the value **Document Storage**.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/tag.png)

Go to the left menu and click on Containers

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/containers.png)

Click on the **models** container and upload all the documents from the model folder in the repository you cloned.  **Don't upload the files from the subfolder empty**.

Your storage should contain the following files.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/files.png)

Go back to the resource group in Azure, you will see two functions, one starting with fnc-model-trainer and the other called fnc-processor.  **Click** on the function **fnc-model-trainer**.

Now click on the Functions item on the left menu.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/func.png)

Click on the **TrainCustomModel** function.

Click in the left menu to **Code + Test**

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/codetest.png)

Now click on the top **Test/Run** button on the top menu.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/testrun.png)

In the new window that appears to the left, you will see **Query** and a button **+ Add parameter**, click on it.

From there, you need to enter **modelName** as the Name and **JobModel** as the Value.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/postparameters.png)

Now click on the blue button **Run**.

Itâ€™s important you note the modelId returned after the Azure Function finishes.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/modelid.png)

If you forget to note the modelId you can always retrieve it using the other endpoint of the Azure Function (see section above).

## Step 6 - Run the Seeder App

Now, you need to generate some documents so the processor function can send them to Form Recognizer.  To do so, you will need to connect to the Azure Virtual Machine called **seeder** in your **resource group**.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/seeder.png)

By default, you cannot connect to the Virtual Machine, the port 3389 is not open and protected by the [Network Security Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview).

If you are using Azure Security Defender you can activate the [Just-in-Time access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-just-in-time?tabs=jit-config-asc%2Cjit-request-asc).  Be aware, you need to have Azure Security Defender Standard and thereâ€™s cost is associated with it. 

The other option is to modify the NSG called **nsg-seeder**.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/nsg-seeder.png)

You can add a new inbound security rule to grant access to the port 3389 but **ONLY** for your **IP address**.  You don't want to open 3389 to Internet, we recommend the Just-In-Time access this is more secure.

If you want to modify the NSG rule, it will look like the following.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/inbound.png)

One you activated the JIT or modified the NSG, you can connect to your virtual machine, using the credentials you created in the **GitHub Secrets**.

Once you are in the virtual machine, open File Explorer and go to the path **C:\git\durableFunctionFormRecognizer\src\consoleSeeder\SeederApp**

You will see a file called **appsettings.json**, open it with Notepad.

You need to add the value for **storageAccountName**. This is the name of your storage account that contains the following tag.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/strtag.png)

In this case, the value of **storageAccountName** will be **strdap3y4htuhu44u**.

The next value you need to add is **storageCnxString**. This is the connection string of the storage found before.  To get the connection string you need to click on Access keys in the storage.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/accesskey.png)

From there, you can click the Show keys button at the top and copy your connection string in the appsettings.json file.

The other value that is important is the **nbrDocuments**, this is the number of documents you want to add in the storage.  To prevent any surprises, if you add multiples documents refer to the [Azure Pricing for Form Recognizer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/form-recognizer/).  In our case, all documents created contains only one page.

To calculate the pricing, you need to use the document type Custom, so if we take this example (pricing change often, this picture can be different than your actual pricing).


![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/frmpricing.png)

If you enter the value **1000** for the nbrDocuments because the pricing is 50$ USD for 1000 pages and all documents are 1 page this will cost you around 50 USD.

Now in the virtual machine open a Command Prompt and do this command

```
cd c:\git\durableFunctionFormRecognizer\src\consoleSeeder\SeederApp
```
Compile the program to be sure 

```
dotnet build -c Release
```

Now you are ready to run the seeder, to do this execute this command.

```
dotnet bin\Release\net5.0\SeederApp.dll
```

## Step 7 - Configure the processor function

You will need to change one configuration of the processor functions, all settings use default value (that you can change) or are set during the creation of the resources.  

Here the list of all settings of the processor function

Name | Description | Default value
---- | ----------- | -------------
BatchSize | Number of blobs to collect in one pass | 1000
MinBacklogSize | Number of blobs the collector keeps ready to process | 1000
NbPartitions | Number of partitions for processing | 10
BlobContainerName | Name of source the blob container | Set during Github Action
StorageAccountConnectionString | Connection string of the source storage | Set during Github Action
CollectDelay | Delay between collection passes | 10 seconds
NoDataDelay | Delay between processing passes when no data | 10 seconds
MaxRetries | Maximum number of retries | 3
RetryMillisecondsPower | The power used for exponential backoff in ms (ex: 2 => 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8) | 2
RetryMillisecondsFactor | The factor used for exponential backoff in ms (ex: 1000 => 2^1x1000=2000) | 1000
FormRecognizerEndpoint | Form Recognizer endpoint | Set during Github Action
FormRecognizerKey | Form Recognizer authentication key | Set during Github Action
FormRecognizerModelId | Form Recognizer model Id | **To be added after step 5**
FormRecognizerTPS | The number of TPS of the Form Recognizer instance | 15
FormRecognizerMinWaitTime | Minimum wait time after submitting a document to Form Recognizer before querying for result | 10 seconds
TableStorageConnectionString | Connection string for the target table storage | Set during Github Action
TableStorageTableName | Name of target table in table storage | Set during Github Action

In step 5 you trained the model, this returned a modelId that you needed to be copied to change the value of the setting **FormRecognizerModelId**.

Now go to the function with the name **fnc-processor**.

Go to the Configuration menu and click the FormRecognizerModelId to change the value of this setting with the trained modelId you got before.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/frmmodel.png)

Once you changed the value, click the **Save button** at the top menu.

## Step 8 - Open the viewer

The viewer is a Blazor applicationt hat will help monitor the durable function execution.  You have two configuration keys you will need to modify.

Go to the Web App called **blazor-admin** and click on it.  Go to the **Configuration** menu.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/configuration.png)

You will need to add two new applications setting here.

| Name | Value
|------|-------
| EndpointUrl | The endpoint of the processor function
| APIKey | The KEY of the processor function

To get those two values, go to the function called **fnc-processor**, from there you will see the URL, this value will be the **EndpointUrl1**.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/url.png)

For the **APIKey** in the Azure Function menu click the menu **App keys**, from there you will see two Host keys, copy the key with the value **default**.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/fnckey.png)

The **Configuration** of the viewer will look like this.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/appsettings.png)

Now in the Viewer click the Start hyperlink

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/start.png)

This will start the Processor Function and you should see the result of each instance (activities) running in parallel. For more details, see the [Viewer section](#blazor-server-viewer).

To track what is happening you can always go to the Log Stream of the processor function.  You will see the log of all processor activities.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/log.png)

Once all documents are finished processing, you will see the total in the viewer and the number of documents processed by each activity function.

![tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugogirard/durableFunctionFormRecognizer/main/images/viewerprocessing.png)

# Problems

## Pipeline failed because of soft delete

If you delete your resources created using the pipeline and run it again is possible, you get an error like this.

**To restore the resource, you must specify 'restore' to be 'true' in the property. If you don't want to restore existing resources, please purge it first**.

This is because Cognitive Services has a soft-delete feature, you will need to purge the instance using Azure CLI.

First run this command

```
az rest --method get --header 'Accept=application/json' -u 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/$SubscriptionId/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/deletedAccounts?api-version=2021-04-30'
```

This will return you the list of all Cognitive Services that are tagged soft-deleted.  Find the one that cause your problem and run the following command.

```
az resource delete --ids $id
```
